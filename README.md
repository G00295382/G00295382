## **What is Markdown?**

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents.

### Why do we use it?

Markdown is essentially used to convert plain text into HTML. Itâ€™s a great tool for the non-programming types and technical writers to write text without having to rely on HTML
